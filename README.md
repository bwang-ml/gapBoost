# Boosted Transfer Learning via Minimizing Performance Gap Between Domains

gapBoost demo for the papers [Transfer Learning via Minimizing Performance Gap Between Domains](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/c66dd00e5fc44ba8de89d7713fedcd50-Abstract.html) in NeurIPS 2019, and  [Gap Minimization for Knowledge Sharing and Transfer](https://jmlr.org/papers/v24/22-0099.html) in JMLR.

## Run the Code

1. Download and install the [LogisticR](http://yelabs.net/software/SLEP/) toolbox. 
2. Download the [20 Newsgroups](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/Data/TextData.html) data set.
3. Add the toolbox and data set into your Matlab path.
4. Run main.m
